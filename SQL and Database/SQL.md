## SQL Notes
Link: [W3 SQL Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
### Table Joins (combine columns from two or more tables)
* (INNER) JOIN: returns records that have matching values in both tables
* LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
* RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
* FULL (OUTER) JOIN: returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table; Null for unmatched cells
* CROSS JOIN: returns the Cartesian product which is the product of rows of two associated tables

#### SELF JOIN: a regular join, but the table is joined with itself
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;
```
##### Ex. Find all the employees who joined before their manager
```sql
# Table Employee(employee_id,manager_id,join_date);
SELECT employee_id
FROM Employee E1 
LEFT JOIN Employee E2 ON E1.employee_id = E2.manager_id
WHERE E1.join_date < E2.join_date
```

##### Ex. (Leetcode 1459) Rectangles Area
```sql
SELECT P1.id AS p1, P2.id AS p2, ABS((P1.x_value - P2.x_value) * (P1.y_value - P2.y_value)) AS area
FROM Points P1
JOIN Points P2 ON P1.id < P2.id AND P1.x_value != P2.x_value AND P1.y_value != P2.y_value
ORDER BY area DESC, p1, p2
```

#### UNION: combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements; selects only distinct values by default
```sql
# UNION ALL: allow duplicate values
SELECT Client FROM MarketA
UNION
SELECT Client FROM MarketA
ORDER BY Client;
```
#### SQL Joins with On or Using
```sql
# USING: shorthand for the situation where the column names are the same
# Ex. Leetcdoe SQL 1677. Product's Worth Over Invoices
SELECT name, 
IFNULL(SUM(rest), 0) AS rest, IFNULL(SUM(paid), 0) AS paid, 
IFNULL(SUM(canceled), 0) AS canceled, IFNULL(SUM(refunded), 0) AS refunded
FROM Product
LEFT JOIN Invoice USING(product_id)
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY name
```

### Edit Data
#### DELETE (delete existing records in a table)
```sql
DELETE FROM tbl WHERE Username = 'Test User'
```

#### Fix date
```sql
# Swap day and month (in SQL Server)
UPDATE TALE 
SET Date = 
  DATEFROMPARTS(
    DATEPART(year, [Date]),
    DATEPART(day, [Date]),  
    DATEPART(month, [Date]))
WHERE ...
```

### Filter Data
#### WHERE & HAVING
WHERE is applied before GROUP BY, HAVING is applied after (and can filter on aggregates).
A HAVING clause is like a WHERE clause, but applies only to groups as a whole (that is, to the rows in the result set representing groups), whereas the WHERE clause applies to individual rows. [Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/visual-db-tools/use-having-and-where-clauses-in-the-same-query-visual-database-tools?view=sql-server-ver15)
_MySQL allows referencing SELECT level aliases in GROUP BY, ORDER BY and HAVING._


#### EXISTS: test for the existence of any record in a subquery; return TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records
##### Ex. Find clients who have purchased products over $100
```sql
SELECT ClientName
FROM Client
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.ClientName = Suppliers.ClientName AND Price > 100)
```

##### Ex. [Find Duplicate Values](https://chartio.com/learn/databases/how-to-find-duplicate-values-in-a-sql-table/)
```sql
SELECT a.* 
FROM
(SELECT ID, Name, COUNT(*)
FROM User 
GROUP BY ID, Name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1) b
JOIN a.ID = b.ID AND a.Name = b.Name
```

#### CASE
Go through conditions and return a value when the first condition is met
#### Use CASE and SUM together to get counts 
##### Ex. Find customer who only order phone
```sql
SELECT CustomerName
FROM 
(SELECT *, SUM(CASE WHEN Product='phone' THEN 1 ELSE 0) AS Phones
FROM Customer
GROUP BY CustomerName) t
WHERE Phones > 0
```

#### COALESCE()
Return the first non-null value in a list

### Transform Data

#### Strings

* [SUBSTRING(string, start, length)](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_mysql_substring.asp): extract a substring from a string
* [LENGTH()](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_mysql_length.asp): return the length of the string

##### Ex. (Leetcode 1667) Fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase
```sql
SELECT user_id, CONCAT(UPPER(LEFT(name,1)), LOWER(SUBSTRING(name, 2))) AS name
FROM Users
ORDER BY user_id
```

#### Date functions
[DATE_FORMAT](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_mysql_date_format.asp)
```sql
YEAR(date) # Return the year part of a date
MONTH(date) # Return the month part of a date
DAY(date) or DAYOFMONTH(date) # Return the day of the month for a date, 'mon'
DAYOFWEEK(date) # Return the weekday index for a date; Sunday is 1
DATEDIFF(date1, date2) # Return number of days between (date1 - date2)
DATE_FORMAT(date, "%Y-%m") # Return the date as Year-Month
DATE_FORMAT(day, "%W, %M %e, %Y") # "day_name, month_name day, year" Ex.  Tuesday, April 12, 2022
```

#### Ranking function
* dense_rank(): assign rank to each row within a partition without gaps
* rank(): assign rank to each row within a partition with gaps
* percent_rank(): returns the percentile rank of a row within a partition that ranges from 0 to 1

##### Ex. Find years when products were first sold 
```sql
SELECT product_id, year
FROM (SELECT product_id, year, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY year) AS 'rank' 
FROM Sales) t
WHERE rank = 1;
```

#### Nonaggregate functions
* [LAG()](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-window-functions/mysql-lag-function/): get value from row that precedes the current row (before)
* LEAD(): get value from row that succeeds the current row (after)
```sql
SELECT price, price - LAG(price, 1) OVER () AS price_diff
FROM Orders
```
* [ROW_NUMBER()](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-window-functions/mysql-row_number-function/): assigns a sequential number to each row in the result set


#### Aggregate functions
* COUNT(): return the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.
* SUM(): return the total sum of a numeric column

##### [Running total](https://popsql.com/learn-sql/mysql/how-to-calculate-cumulative-sum-running-total-in-mysql)
```sql
WITH ClientCountsByYear AS 
(SELECT YEAR(PurchaseDate), COUNT(*) As ClientCounts
FROM Clients
GROUP BY year)
SELECT year, SUM(Counts) OVER (ORDER BY year) AS cum_sum
FROM ClientCountsByYear;
```

* AVG(): return the average value of a numeric column
 
##### Ex. Given salary(department_id,employee_id,salary), list all employees with salary greater than the average department salary and also greather than $50K
```sql
SELECT employee_id
FROM 
(SELECT *, AVG(SALARY) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) AS depart_avg
FROM salary) S
WHERE salary > 50000
```

#### [Combine strings under same group](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31211506/how-stuff-and-for-xml-path-work-in-sql-server)
```sql
SELECT ID,  AllNames = STUFF(
  (SELECT ',' + name FROM temp1 t1 WHERE t1.id = t2.id
  FOR XML PATH ('')), 1, 1, '') 
FROM temp1 t2
GROUP BY ID;
```

### CTE (Common Table Expressions)
#### Recursive CTE (having a subquery that refers to its own name)
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte (n) AS
(
  SELECT 1
  UNION ALL
  SELECT n + 1 FROM cte WHERE n < 5
)
SELECT * FROM cte;

# Result table
+------+
| n    |
+------+
|    1 |
|    2 |
|    3 |
|    4 |
|    5 |
+------+
```

#### Multiple CTEs
```sql
WITH cte1 AS
(SELECT * FROM ...),
cte2 as
(SELECT * FROM ...),
cte3 as
(SELECT * FROM ... INNER JOIN cte2 ON...),
SELECT *
FROM cte1
JOIN cte3 ON ...
```


### [Variables](https://www.javatpoint.com/mysql-variables)
To store data in memory and can be used throughout the program
* User-Defined Variable: starts with @ symbol; pass values from one statement to another statement; does not reinitialized with NULL
```sql
# Assign the value in MySQL
SET @var_name = value;  
SELECT @var_name := value;  

# Assign the value in SQL Server
DECLARE @var_name AS INT = YEAR(GETDATE());
```
* Local Variable: strongly typed variable; is reinitialized with NULL value each time whenever stored procedure is called
* System Variable: various system variables that configure its operation, and each system variable contains a default value

### Pratical Examples
#### [Find outliers](https://dataschool.com/how-to-teach-people-sql/how-to-find-outliers-with-sql/)
##### Order by
Sort the relevant values in both ascending and descending order
##### NTILES()
Separate our data into the same number of groups as the value inside the brackets

#### Pivot â€” Rows to Columns; allow you to display row values as columns
MySQL does not have PIVOT function; use a CASE expression along with an aggregate function

[PIVOT and UNPIVOT in SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/from-using-pivot-and-unpivot?view=sql-server-ver15)

##### Ex. Get results of each client's order numbers in different month
```sql
SELECT ClientName,  
SUM(MONTH(Order) = 'January') AS Order_Jan,
SUM(MONTH(Order) = 'February') AS Order_Feb
...
FROM table
GROUP BY ClientName
```

##### Ex. Given Monthly_Revenue (company_name,month,revenue), Write a query to pull the monthly revenue as columns instead of rows.
```sql
SELECT company_name,
# Using CASE WHEN
SUM(CASE WHEN (month='January') THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS January
# Using IF
SUM(IF(month='January', revenue, NULL)) AS January
...
FROM Monthly_Revenue
GROUP BY company_name
```

```sql
# PIVOT in SQL Server
SELECT company_name, [January], [February], [March], [April], [May], [June], [July], [August], [September], [October], [November], [December]
FROM Monthly_Revenue
PIVOT(
SUM(revenue) FOR month IN ([January], [February], [March], [April], [May], [June], [July], [August], [September], [October], [November], [December])
) as PivotTable
```

##### Ex. (Leetcode 618) Students Report By Geography if it is unknown which continent has the most students, 

```sql
## MAX ignores any null values. MAX returns NULL when there is no row to select.
SELECT
    MAX(CASE WHEN continent = 'America' THEN name END)AS America,
    MAX(CASE WHEN continent = 'Asia' THEN name END)AS Asia,
    MAX(CASE WHEN continent = 'Europe' THEN name END)AS Europe  
FROM (SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY continent ORDER BY name) AS id FROM student) AS t
GROUP BY id
```
