### [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](https://realpython.com/the-model-view-controller-mvc-paradigm-summarized-with-legos/)

* Routes: each route is associated with a certain function within a controller (controller action)
* Controller: responsible for grabbing all of the necessary building blocks and organizing them as necessary.
* Models: help the controller retrieve all of the information it needs from the database, loada a view, and pass along the data structure.
* View: accesses the structure of data and uses it to render the requested page, which is then presented to the user in their browser.
