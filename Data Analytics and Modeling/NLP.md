## Natural Language Processing

### Text Mining

Text mining is the process of examining large collections of text and converting the unstructured text data into structured data for further analysis like visualization and model building.

### Word Embedding

 > "training a model with a neural network auto-encoder (one of Google's word2vec algorithms) that best describes corpus words in their local linguistic contexts, and exploring their locations in the resulting space to learn about the discursive culture that produced them" (Computational COntent Analysis class HW6 Tutorial)
