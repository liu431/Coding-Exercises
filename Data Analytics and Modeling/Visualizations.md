1. Tell the truth
2. Know your audience

### Chart Types
[Tableau - Types of Charts and Graphs](https://www.tableau.com/learn/whitepapers/which-chart-or-graph-is-right-for-you)
* Pie Chart: powerful for adding detail to other visualizations
* Bar chart: compare data across categories, highlight differences, show trends and outliers, and reveal historical highs and lows at a glance.
  * Common mistake: [adjust your starting axis](https://uxdesign.cc/the-most-common-mistake-designers-make-when-adjusting-their-bar-charts-6f7405d69703) 
    * Problem: change the comparison points that people can make between the categories
    * Solution: horizontal bar chart; rethink the visualization message
* Line Chart: visualize changes in one value relative to another
* Maps: show how location correlates with trends in your data
* Density Maps: identify locations with greater or fewer numbers of data points
* Scatter Plot: investigate the relationship between different variables, showing if one variable is a good predictor of another, or if they tend to change independently
* Gantt Chart: display a project schedule or show changes in activity over time
* Bubble Chart: add detail to scatter plots or maps to show the relationship between three or more measures
* Treemap: relate different segments of your data to the whole
* [Boxplot](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-boxplots-5e2df7bcbd51): display the distribution of data based on a five number summary (“minimum”, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and “maximum”). It can tell you about your outliers and what their values are.
