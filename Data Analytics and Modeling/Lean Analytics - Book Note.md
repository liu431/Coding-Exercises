Authors: Alistair Croll and Benjamin Yoskovitz

### Preface
* Lean: eliminate  wate and move quickly
* Lean startup: build -> measure -> learn cycle
> A startup is an organization formed to search for a scalable and repeatable business model. --- Steve Blank

### Stop ling to yourself
#### We're all liars
* Instincts are experiments. Data is proof.
* Reply less on your reality distortion field, and rely more on on Lean Analytics.
* When you think you've found a worthwhile idea, decide how to test it quickly with minimul experiment. Define what success looks like beforehand, and know what you're going to do if your hunch is right.

#### How to keep score
* Analytics: track the metrics that are metrics that are critical to your business.
* Purpose: find your way to the right product and market before the money runs out.
* Good metric that will drive the changes
  - Comparative
  - Understandable
  - A ratio or a rate
    - Easier to act on
    - Inherently comparative
    - Compare factors that are somehow opposed, or for which there's an inherent tension
  - __Change the way you behave__: what will you do differently based on changes in the metric?
  - Often come in pairs
    - Conversion rate and time-to-purchase -> cash flow
    - Viral coefficients and viral cycle time -> adoption rate
* Metric types
  - Qualitative (answers "why"; collected from interviews) vs Quantitative (the numbers)  
  - Vanity (the numbers that make you feel good but seriously mislead) vs Real (actionable; drive changes)
  - Exploratory (unknown unknowns) vs Reporting (known unknowns) 
  - Leading (predict the future) vs Lagging (already happened and cannot be acted on, such as churn)
  - Correlated (predict what will happen) vs Causal (you can change itif knowing the cause)

* Moving targets
Adjust goals and how you define the key metrics is acceptable.

Update metrcis accordingly provided that you're able to prove the value created.

* Testing
  - Segmentation: a group that shares some common characteristics
  - Cohort analysis: compare similar groups over time; patterns against the lifecycle of a customer
  - A/B and multivariate testing: differnet groups of test subjects are given different experiences at the same time
  - Lean Analytics cycle: find a meaning metric, then run experiments to improve it until that metric is good enough for you to move to the next problem or the next stage of the business
