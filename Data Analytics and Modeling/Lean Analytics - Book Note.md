## Lean Analytics: Use Data to Build a Better Startup Faster

Authors: Alistair Croll and Benjamin Yoskovitz

### Preface
* Lean: eliminate  wate and move quickly
* Lean startup: build -> measure -> learn cycle
> A startup is an organization formed to search for a scalable and repeatable business model. --- Steve Blank

### Part 1: Stop lying to yourself
#### We're all liars
* Instincts are experiments. Data is proof.
* Reply less on your reality distortion field, and rely more on on Lean Analytics.
* When you think you've found a worthwhile idea, decide how to test it quickly with minimul experiment. Define what success looks like beforehand, and know what you're going to do if your hunch is right.

#### How to keep score
* Analytics: track the metrics that are metrics that are critical to your business.
* Purpose: find your way to the right product and market before the money runs out.
* Good metric that will drive the changes
  - Comparative
  - Understandable
  - A ratio or a rate
    - Easier to act on
    - Inherently comparative
    - Compare factors that are somehow opposed, or for which there's an inherent tension
  - __Change the way you behave__: what will you do differently based on changes in the metric?
  - Often come in pairs
    - Conversion rate and time-to-purchase -> cash flow
    - Viral coefficients and viral cycle time -> adoption rate
* Metric types
  - Qualitative (answers "why"; collected from interviews) vs Quantitative (the numbers)  
  - Vanity (the numbers that make you feel good but seriously mislead) vs Real (actionable; drive changes)
  - Exploratory (unknown unknowns) vs Reporting (known unknowns) 
  - Leading (predict the future) vs Lagging (already happened and cannot be acted on, such as churn)
  - Correlated (predict what will happen) vs Causal (you can change itif knowing the cause)

* Moving targets
  - Adjust goals and how you define the key metrics is acceptable.
  - Update metrcis accordingly provided that you're able to prove the value created.

* Testing
  - Segmentation: a group that shares some common characteristics
  - Cohort analysis: compare similar groups over time; patterns against the lifecycle of a customer
  - A/B and multivariate testing: different groups of test subjects are given different experiences at the same time
  - Lean Analytics cycle: find a meaning metric, then run experiments to improve it until that metric is good enough for you to move to the next problem or the next stage of the business

#### Deciding what to do with your life
* Lean Canvas
  1. Problems - real problems people know they have
  2. Customer segments - target markets, targeting messages
  3. Unique value proposition - clear, distinctive, memorable way to explain why you're better or different
  4. Solution - solve the problems in the right way
  5. Channels - get product or service to customers and their money nack to you
  6. Revenue streams - one-time/recurring, direct/indirect transaction
  7. Cost structure - direct, variable, and indirect costs to pay for
  8. Metrics - numbers to track to understand if you're making progress
  9. Unfair advantage - "force multiplier" that makes efforts have greater impact than competitors
  10. _Do you want to do it?_ - passion for solving the problem
      - Can I do this thing I'm hoping to do well?
      - Whether you like doing this thing?
      - Be sure you can make money doing it.

* Fundamental question at early stages: Should I go build this thing?

#### Data-Driven vs. Data-Informed
* Quan data is great for testing hypotheses, but it's lousy for generating new ones unless combined with human introspection.
* Founders are actually building a tool to learn what product to build.

### Part 2: Finding the right metric for right now
#### Analytics Frameworks
* Dave McClure's pirate metrics

|Element|Function|Relevant metrics|
|---|---|---|
|Acquisition|Generate attention throgh a variety of means, both organic and inorganic|Traffic, mentions, cost per click, search results, cost of acquisition, open rate|
|Activation|Turn the resulting drive-by visitors into users who are somehow enrolled|Enrollments, signups, completed onboarding process, used the service at least once, subscriptions|
|Retention|Convince users to come back repeatedly, exhibiting sticky behavior|Engagement, time since last visit, daily and monthly active use, churns|
|Revenue|Business outcomes, such as purchases, ad clicks, content creation, subscriptions, etc.|Customer lifetime value, conversion rate, shopping cart size, click-through revenue|
|Referral|Viral and word-of-mouth invitations to other potential users|Invites sent, viral coefficient, viral cycle time|

* Eric Ries's engines of growth
  - Sticky engine - get users to return and keep using the product
    - KPI: customer retention, churn rates, usage frquency, time since last visit, email open rates, click-through rates...
  - Virality engine -  get the words out
    - KPI: viral coefficient (number of new users that each user brings on), actions that make up the cycle, viral cycle time (speed which a user invites another), type of virality
  - Paid engine - payment
     - KPI: CLV (customer lifetime value), CAC (customer acquisition cost), time to customer breakeven (recoup the acquisition cost of a customer)

* Ash Maurya's Lean Canvas

|Lean Canvas box|Some relevant metrics|
|---|---|
|Problem|Respondents who have this need, respondents who are aware of having the need|
|Solution|Respondents who try the MVP, engagement, churn, most-used/least-used features, people willing to buy|
|Unique value proposition|Feedback scores, independnet ratings, sentiment analysis, customer-worded descriptions, surveys, search and competitive analysis|
|Customer segments|How easy is it to find groups of prospects, uniqe key-word segments, targeted funnel traffic from a particular source|
|Channels|Leads and customers per channel, viral coefficients and cycle, net promoter score, oepn rate, affiliate margins, click-through rate, PageRank, message reach|
|Unfair advantage|Respondents' understanding of the unique value proposition, patents, brand equity, barrier to entry, number of new entrants, exclusivity of relationships|
|Cost structure|Fixed costs, cost of customer acquisition, cost of servicing the n-th customer, support costs, keyword costs|

* Sean Ellis's startup growth pyramid
  - Product/market fit -> decide what you sell to whom, then prove it
  - Stack the odds -> Find a defensible unfair advantage and tweak it
  - Scale growth -> step on the gas in new markets, products, and channels

* Long funnel - customers make several tentative visits prior to a conversion
  - Help understand how you first come to someone's attention, and the journey she takes from that initial awareness through to a goal you wnat her to complete

* Lean analytics stages: Empathy, Stickiness, Virality, Revenue, Scale   

#### The discipline of one metric that matters
* Secret to startup success: __focus__
* Pick a minimal set of KPIs to saty focus
* Changes depending on the company's stage
  - Acquire users: which acquisition channels are working best or the conversion rate from signup to active user
  - Retention: churn, experiment with pricing, features, improve customer support, and so on.
* What success looks like?
  - Business model
  - Look at what's normal or ideal, such as industry baseline

#### What business are you in?
* 5 "knobs" for business growth
  - More stuff - add products or services that customers wnat
  - More people - add users through virality or world of mouth
  - More often - stickiness, reduced churn, repeated use
  - More money - unsell and maximize the price users will pay, or the revenue from ad clicks, or the accoumt of content they create, or the number of in-game purchases they make
  - More efficiently - reduce the cost of delivering and supporting your service, lower the cost of customer acquisition by doing less paid advertising and more word of mouth

* Business model flipbook
  - Acquisition channel: how people find out about you
  - Selling tactic: how you comvince visitors to become users or users to become customers
  - Revenue source: how you make money
  - Product type: what value your business offers in return for the revenue
  - Delivery model: how you get product to the customer

* 12 revenue models

Avertising, Consulting, Data, Lead generation, licensing fee, listing fee, Ownership/hardware, Rental, Sponsorship, Subscription, Transaction fee, Virtual goods
